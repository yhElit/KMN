# KMN
Implementation and testing of a basic version of K means neighbors (KMN) in Python from scratch

**Dataset:**
- [White wine quality](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/piyushagni5/white-wine-quality)
- split in training and test data

**Note:**
- the number of clusters k and max iterations are user parameters
- algorithm automatically stops when cluster centers donâ€˜t change anymore
- clusters with their centroids are
visualized at each iteration
- scikit-learn is used to compare runtime and results of multiple runs
